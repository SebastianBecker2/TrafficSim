# TrafficSim
This project is intended as a way to get into some SFML using dear imgui.

The end goal of the software itself is to simulate traffic with cars on single- and multi-lane roads with crossings and traffic lights.

The end goal of the code, on the other hand, is to be standard C++ 17 code, that is reflecting best practices and readability.
